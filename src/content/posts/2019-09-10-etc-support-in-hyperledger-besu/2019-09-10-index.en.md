I am very happy to announce that the ETC Cooperative are funding [ChainSafe](https://chainsafe.io/) to implement Ethereum Classic support for the [Hyperledger Besu](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Hyperledger+Besu) codebase, so that we will have an additional choice of client software for ETC in the near future.

Hyperledger Besu (formerly known as Pantheon) is a Apache 2.0 licensed, enterprise-grade Java codebase developed by the [PegaSys](https://pegasys.tech/) protocol engineering team, a spoke at ConsenSys over the last two years. It is compliant with the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)](https://entethalliance.org/) specification, ETH mainnet compatible, and supports Ethash, Clique and IBFT2 consensus.

It was [contributed to Hyperledger](https://www.coindesk.com/hyperledger-adds-consensys-enterprise-project-to-consortium) just a few weeks ago and will now be maintained collectively within that Linux Foundation collaboration workflow.

I was delighted to see PegaSys contribute Besu to Hyperledger, because it achieves a goal which I was personally striving for over 3 years ago!

I hosted an [Open Source Blockchain Meetup](https://bobsummerwill.com/2016/06/12/cats-and-dogs-can-be-friends/) in May 2016 at OSCON where I first met Brian Behlendorf and began my multi-year quest to bring the Ethereum and Hyperledger communities closer.

See also [Ethereum Everywhere](https://bobsummerwill.com/2016/07/12/ethereum-everywhere/) and [Bobâ€™s Next Adventure](https://bobsummerwill.com/2017/10/18/bobs-next-adventure/) for more history.

I was privileged to see the very beginnings of this codebase, which were entwined in the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance which I was also personally involved with. PegaSys have an all-star protocol engineering team and have built something very special here.

To see that shared within the context of Hyperledger makes me so very proud, and the opportunity to add ETC support was an opportunity not to be missed.

We really need the client diversity within ETC and there is no better vehicle for the collective development of a blockchain client codebase than Hyperledger, IMHO.
ChainSafe are absolutely the right choice for the job, having recently updated Classic Geth for the ETC Atlantis hardfork. They also worked on the Kotti project with the ETC Cooperative. They have a fantastically talented team and are great to work with. Their CEO, Aidan Hyman, will be speaking at ETC Summit in Vancouver this year.

The ETC Cooperative have also applied for associate membership of Hyperledger, though membership is not necessary to contribute to the open source projects under the banner. We want to signal our commitment to the Hyperledger project as a whole, and to being good citizens.

So, away we go!
