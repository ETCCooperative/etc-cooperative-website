We are pleased to share [ETC Cooperative's Board Package for Q3](https://etccooperative.org/ETC-Coop-Q3-2022-Report.pdf).

Highlights:

 - Ongoing Core-Geth development work, with several upstream patches, a fix of consensus bug in Etchash, and improved dialogue between the Core-Geth and Hyperledger Besu clients.
 - Initiated [Erigon](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/erigon) development work, a Go-Ethereum fork that reduces bloat: Full synchronization on ETC took a few days, and used about 160 GB. 
 - Ongoing Hyperledger Besu development work, with 7 releases.
 - Full deployment and launch of Gnosis Safe to ETC mainnet and Mordor testnet: [Ethereum Classic Safe](https://multisig.etccooperative.org/app/welcome)
 - Documentation: A website for [“Risk Evaluation of 51-Percent Attacks on Ethereum Classic”](https://meowsbits.github.io/51-percent-docs/) has been created so the community can further trust the ETC blockchain.
 - Ended September of 2022 with liquid assets, including cash plus $ETC, of over $5.5M USD.
 - Budgeted spending was $414K USD to the end of Q3 but actual spending was only $239K USD.
