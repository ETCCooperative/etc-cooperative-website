This multimillion dollar grants DAO has been eagerly expected by the Ethereum Classic ecosystem, so we asked Bob about the details that may be of most interest to the community:

1. What is the ETC Grants DAO?

2. What is the timing of applications and when will the winning teams receive the grants?

3. How large is the program's fund and what is the allocation for this particular round?

4. Who funded it, and what are the program's goals?

5. Who can apply and what are the project categories?

6. A list of project ideas as a guide for teams.

7. Where does a team apply and how does the process work?
