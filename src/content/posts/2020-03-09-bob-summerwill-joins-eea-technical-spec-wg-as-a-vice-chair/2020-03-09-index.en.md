I am delighted to announce that my proposal to serve as a Vice-Chair of the EEA (Enterprise Ethereum Alliance) Technical Specification Working Group has been confirmed by the EEA Board today.

The ETC Cooperative [applied to join the EEA](/posts/2019-09-12-etc-cooperative-applying-to-join-eea) in September 2019 and were [announced as members](/posts/2019-10-18-etc-coop-joins-eea) in October 2019.

This role is the continuation of a multi-year personal journey for me, going back to [Cats and Dogs Can Be Friends](https://bobsummerwill.com/2016/06/12/cats-and-dogs-can-be-friends/) and [Ethereum Everywhere](https://bobsummerwill.com/2016/07/12/ethereum-everywhere/) in 2016.

I was Co-Lead Architect for the EEA during the launch period, co-presented the Technical Roadmap at the launch event, then served as Secretary to the initial Technical Working Group and as Vice-Chair of the Technical Steering Committee until October 2017.

As many of us stated at the very beginning of the EEA journey, there is no reason why a suitable modular Ethereum codebase cannot serve all public and enterprise use-cases.   A primary goal of the EEA is to work towards a specification to help meet that goal.

I recently spent two days at the London face-to-face meeting.  We are [getting there](https://entethalliance.github.io/client-spec/spec.html)!

It is a delight for me to be in a position to help directly drive that goal again, after several years “on the outside”.
