We are pleased to share [ETC Cooperative's Board Package for July and August](/ETC-Coop-Board-Package-July-August-2021.pdf).

Highlights:

- Successful activation of the Magneto hard-fork.
- ETC Core launch new [ETC Node Explorer](https://etclabscore.github.io/nodes-interface/)
- Treasury progresses during July and August, but that is followed by [withdrawal of support by ETC Cooperative](./2021-09-20-withdraws-support-for-ecip-1098) in September.
- Exceptional amount of Grayscale funding during April to August, as ETC
prices hit an all-time high during May.  Nearly $2.8M USD of revenue was received or has been accrued by the ETC Coop from April to August leaving over $3.2M USD of assets on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter (cash balance and receivables).
- Ongoing Comms and Marketing work.
- Ongoing support for Ethercluster and BlockScout.
