The ETC Cooperative is a public charity and all of our funding comes from voluntary donations.

[Grayscale Investments](https://grayscale.co/) are our primary and only continuous source of funding.
They have donated one third of their fees from the Grayscale® Ethereum Classic Trust to the ETC Cooperative since 2017.   In January 2020 it was announced that [their support was being extended](https://etccooperative.org/grayscale-extends-support-of-etc-cooperative/).

DFG made a one-off donation of $250K in May 2018 and the Ethereum Foundation made a one-off donation of 15,000 ETC in October 2018.

We welcome corporation or individual donations, either in fiat currency or as cryptocurrency.   We have IRS reporting obligations so we cannot accept anonymous or pseudonymous donations.

If you would like to donate to the ETC Cooperative, please contact bob@etccooperative.org.

The ETC wallet is at [0x217db77248a60f1f4e3ab31c6e8fb7ab0c05cf53](https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet/address/0x217db77248a60f1f4e3ab31c6e8fb7ab0c05cf53/transactions).   Any donations from unknown sources would be returned.
