To the Community and Media,

We are delighted to announce some exciting news on behalf of the ETC GRANTS DAO (EGD), a non-profit organization formed by supporters and builders of Ethereum Classic.

Our mission is to promote technical development and community engagement in the Ethereum Classic ecosystem and develop it into a globally leading smart-contract-based POW public chain.

Since November 2022, the collective including BITMAIN, ANTPOOL and ETC Cooperative has been hard at work building and promoting the ETC GRANTS DAO.  In January 2023, we launched the first round of the grants program with up to $1M worth of ETC funding. 

Through these incentives, we seek to foster innovation and development in areas such as dapps, stablecoins and lending protocols, bridges and interoperability, atomic swaps, developer tools, and L2 scaling solutions.

The application period was a great success, with a total of 66 project applications received over 89 days. The grant review committee, formed by BITMAIN, ANTPOOL, and the ETC Cooperative, evaluated all applications thoroughly. After 75 days and some difficult decisions, we ultimately selected 19 projects to fund. The funded projects span various fields, including tools/developer platforms, community, media, DeFi, NFT, DAO, games, etc. 

Each project will receive ETC funding ranging from $3,800 to $50,000. The total funding amount of this round is nearly $700,000. These funds, in the form of ETC, will be stored in a multi-sig wallet on the Ethereum Classic mainnet and will be distributed in batches through milestone audits.

We are thrilled to share this exciting information and look forward to your continued support. This project marks an exciting new chapter for the Ethereum Classic community and the entire blockchain ecosystem.

We deeply appreciate your support and attention!
