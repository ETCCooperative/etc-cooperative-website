[Consensus](https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2020) is the leading blockchain conference of the year and the highlight of New York blockchain week.
In the height of the Coronovirus pandemic, Consensus 2020 will take a different form
than in previous years, as a virtual conference free of charge for participants.

**Foundations at Consensus: Distributed**

Foundations is a new program within Consensus designed to put the spotlight on thriving blockchain ecosystems. Itâ€™s a chance for protocols and projects to design a series of conference sessions specifically aimed at their community: which means developers and other technical contributors as well as the investors, customers and founders. 

We are delighted to announce that [Ethereum Classic](https://ethereumclassic.org)
will be participating in the Foundations track of Consensus, with an hour of
content devoted to ETC.

That content is planned for **Tuesday 12th, 3-4pm Eastern**.

**What will we be covering in this session?**

Bob Summerwill and Yaz Khoury of the ETC Cooperative will be the presenters
with Bob presenting a "Changelog" in which he will preview the ETC Phoenix hardfork due in June along with other recent and coming developments in ETC.  There will
be an extended Q&A session, so bring your ETC questions!

Yaz will then be presenting on development and developer relations.

Join us to find out what is so special about ETC.
