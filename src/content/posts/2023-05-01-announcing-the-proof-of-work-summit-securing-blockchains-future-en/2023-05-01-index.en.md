The ETC Cooperative is pleased to announce that we have partnered with the Litecoin Foundation to bring you the first annual [**‘Proof-of-Work Summit’ - Securing Blockchain’s Future**](https://powsummit.com/).  The conference will be held in Prague, Czech Republic on Sept 25-27 2023, and will be a celebration of the world's most effective and secure consensus mechanism. 

Prague is a beautiful city with a rich history, and stunning architecture, and is the birthplace of the world’s first Bitcoin mining pool, hardware wallet, and Bitcoin cafe. There is no doubt that Prague offers a perfect setting for the first Proof-of-Work Conference.

Since Ethereum announced its switch from POW to POS, citing environmental costs as one of the main motivations, there has been a great deal of misinformation in the popular media about Proof-of-Work. The ‘Proof-of-Work Summit’ aims to refute and respond to these narratives by examining POW, why it’s essential for privacy, and why the environmental concerns are overblown and misguided.

The Summit will begin with an opening night dinner on the 25th at [VNITROBLOCK](https://vnitroblock.cz/) and then continue with talks and workshops on Sept 26 & 27th in the [O2 Universum](https://www.o2universum.cz/en). 

Experts from around the globe will converge in Prague to dig into the history, the misconceptions, and future of the POW consensus protocol. Some of the esteemed speakers who will be speaking are;

- **Charlie Shrem** - Bitcoin Pioneer

- **Charlie Lee** -  Creator of Litecoin

- **Jameson Lopp** - Professional Cypherpunk

- **Caitlin Long** - former Wall St veteran turned Founder and CEO of Custodia Bank 

More speakers will be added soon.  

The conference will include a variety of workshops, panel discussions, and networking opportunities, providing attendees with the opportunity to connect with other blockchain enthusiasts and experts. There will be ample time for attendees to network, exchange ideas, and explore new opportunities.

The tickets for the conference are on sale now, and we encourage everyone who is interested in Proof-of-Work to attend. This is a fantastic opportunity to gain insights into Proof-of-Work, connect with experts in the field, and discover new opportunities.

We look forward to seeing you in Prague for the first Proof-of-Work Conference!
