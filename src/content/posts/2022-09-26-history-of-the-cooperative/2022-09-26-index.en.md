Bob was hired as Executive Director in January 2019, so there was around 18 months of activity which predated his time at the Cooperative.  In November 2019, heading into the 2020 AGM for the Ethereum Classic Cooperative, he spent time building a canonical history of the ETC Cooperative, from its beginnings and announcement at ETC Summit 2017 through to the end of 2019.

Somehow this document was never released to the public, so we are belatedly publishing it now, together with adding it to the [Filings page](/filings).  It is interesting historically and contains links to numerous early blog posts and articles.

Reports on broken links, incorrect information or missing content would be gratefully received.
