This is an important announcement for wallet operators, exchanges, mining pools, dapp developers, and all other users of the Ethereum Classic mainnet and Mordor testnet Ethercluster endpoints: The Ethercluster service will be discontinued by July 24 2023.

**PLEASE CHANGE YOUR ENDPOINTS FROM ETHERCLUSTER TO THE FOLLOWING BY JULY 24 2023**

As [we announced](https://etccooperative.org/posts/2023-01-02-the-ethereum-classic-rpc-url-is-changing-from-ethercluster-to-rivet-en) in January of this year, the ETC Cooperative is changing the RPC URL for the Ethereum Classic mainnet from Ethercluster to Rivet. Additionally, we have also moved the Ethercluster Mordor testnet endpoint to a new one.

**The Ethercluster endpoints that will be discontinued for the mainnet and testnet on July 24 are:**

ETC mainnet: https://ethercluster.com/etc

Mordor testnet:  https://ethercluster.com/mordor

**The new ones to be used, which are already active so you may migrate right now, are the following:**

ETC mainnet: https://etc.rivet.link

Mordor testnet: https://rpc.mordor.etccooperative.org

You can learn about the rationale for the change to Rivet as a professional provider and their support capabilities [here](https://etccooperative.org/posts/2023-01-02-the-ethereum-classic-rpc-url-is-changing-from-ethercluster-to-rivet-en).

The move for the Mordor testnet is due to the discontinuation of the Ethercluster brand as a whole. 

**PLEASE MAKE SURE TO MIGRATE THE ETC MAINNET AND MORDOR TESTNET ENDPOINTS BY JULY 24 2023.**
