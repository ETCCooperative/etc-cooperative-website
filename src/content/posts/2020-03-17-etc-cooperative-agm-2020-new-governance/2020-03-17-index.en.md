**17th March 2020 – Vancouver, Canada** – The Annual General Meeting for the ETC Cooperative was held today at 12.30pm EDT:

* [ETC Coop 2020 Agenda](/ETC-Coop-2020-AGM-Agenda.pdf)

One of the primary tasks assigned to me when I joined the ETC Cooperative as Executive Director just over a year ago was **"design and put in place a new governance structure for the ETC Coop"**.

That work has taken another step forward today as the culmination of months of work alongside our new Treasurer, [Alison Alexis CPA](/posts/2019-10-19-alison-alexis-joins-etc-coop), who has been instrumental to our progress.

Two Resolutions were passed today, which strengthened our Board of Directors and put the new governance policies, processes and procedures in place to enhance the ETC Cooperative's transparency and overall mission:

* [ETC Coop 2020 Resolutions (Election and Resignation of Directors)](/ETC-Coop-2020-Resolutions-Election-and-Removal-of-Directors.pdf)
* [ETC Coop 2020 Resolutions (Election and Removal of Officers, Approving Policies and Corporation Governance Documentation)](/ETC-Coop-2020-Resolutions-Election-and-Removal-of-Officers-Approving-Policies-and-Corporation-Governance-Documentation.pdf)

Documents describing our new governance as well as our roadmap for 2020, our goals and means of self-assessment and our Budget:

* [ETC Coop 2020 Goals & Objectives](/ETC-Coop-2020-Goals-Objectives.xlsx)

* [ETC Coop Gift and Donation Policy](/ETC-Coop-Gift-and-Donation-Policy.pdf)
* [ETC Coop Whistleblower Policy](/ETC-Coop-Whistleblower-Policy.pdf)

The [etccooperative.org](https://etccooperative.org) website will be updated with this content, plus all prior resolutions, over the next week or so.   We are still working on completing the 2019 Retrospective which is about 60 pages of information and builds on the transparency that the ETC Cooperative has demonstrated with the 2018 mid-year and end-of-year reports.

Here are the By-Laws, IRS determination letter and our 990 filing with the IRS for the 2018 tax year:

* [ETCC-Inc.-By-Laws-EXECUTED-05-10-18](/ETCC-Inc.-By-Laws-EXECUTED-05-10-18.pdf) (By-Laws passed in 2018)
* [ETC Cooperative - 501(c)(3) - IRS Approved - Contains EIN](/ETC-Cooperative-501c3-IRS-Approved-Contains-EIN.pdf) (Determination letter)
* [ETC Coop 2018 Form 990](/ETC-Coop-2018-Form-990.pdf) (Filing with the IRS)

The process for 2019 filings will be starting soon, in accordance with statutory deadlines.

I am delighted to welcome our new Directors, who should be familiar faces to most people, as we continue our mission of accelerating the growth of Ethereum Classic.
