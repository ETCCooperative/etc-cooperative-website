We are delighted to announce that Charles Hoskinson has joined the
Board of the ETC Cooperative.

Charles was a member of the initial [Advisory Board](./2018-03-01-announcing-the-etc-cooperative-board-of-advisors) for the ETC Cooperative back in early 2018 and it is a pleasure to welcome him back.  Charles brings unique experience and insight to the table.

There are now six board members - **Barry Silbert**, **Cody Burns**, **Elaine Ou**, **Roy Zou**, **Charles Hoskinson** and **Craig Salm**, who is
the Chair of the Board.

Charles needs little introduction within the ETC community, given his
long-standing support for the ETC ecosystem all the way back to 2016.
He [laid out IOHK's first commitments](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2016/09/09/ethereum-classic-an-update/) in the immediate aftermath of the DAO fork and the birth of ETC.

The Mantis client was originally released in [July 2017](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2017/08/08/mantis-ethereum-classic-beta-release/) after seven months
of work from the Grothendieck Team.  Development was paused in December 2018
but resumed in late 2020.  Mantis is the only ETC-specific client and has
by far the largest development team.  See the new [Mantis website](https://mantisclient.io/) for more details.
