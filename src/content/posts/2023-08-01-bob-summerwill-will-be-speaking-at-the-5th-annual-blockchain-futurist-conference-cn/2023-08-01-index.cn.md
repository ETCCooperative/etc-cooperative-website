We are happy to announce that Bob Summerwill, Executive Director of the ETC Cooperative, will be speaking at the [5th Annual Blockchain Futurist Conference](https://www.futuristconference.com/), Canada's largest crypto, web3, and blockchain  Event!

The event will take place on August 15 and 16 2023 in Toronto, Canada, and will feature themes ranging from DeFi, payments, stablecoins, and DAOs to global regulation, compliance, identity, privacy, and web3.

Bob will be addressing the fallacies surrounding proof of work as a consensus mechanism and its energy use, will review the original intent of Cypherpunks with regards to security, decentralization and privacy, refer to the Ethereum transition to Proof of Stake and why PoS is centralized, and review Ethereum Classic's strong market positioning and prospects for the future.

We will be posting a summary and video of Bob's talk on our blog.
