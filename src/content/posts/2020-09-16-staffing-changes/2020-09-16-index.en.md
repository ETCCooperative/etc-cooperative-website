We bid a fond farewell to Yaz Khoury, who served as Director of Developer
Relations at ETC Cooperative from October 2018.  He wore many hats, both within the ETC Cooperative and
in the broader ETC community.

more about Yaz's work](/posts/2019-10-17-yaz-contract-extension/).

Some 2020 highlights included the migration of all of
the ETC Cooperative's infrastucture to Hyperledger
Besu, serving as a Vice-Chair of the EEA Testnet Working Group, presenting webinars on Ethereum for
the Hyperledger community, working with Connext to
set up the first State Channels hub for ETC and successfully migrating the ETC BlockScout
instances onto ETC Cooperative infrastructure.

Yaz was also an ECIP editor, an important steward
for the ETC protocol and an active and valued member
of the ETC community.  He will be sorely missed
at the ETC Cooperative.  We wish him the very best
for the future.
