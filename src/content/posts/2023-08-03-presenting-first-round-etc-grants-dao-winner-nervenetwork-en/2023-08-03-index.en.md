We are happy to present [NerveNetwork](https://etcgrants.softr.app/funded-project-details-en?recordId=recX5SnfUaW7StHiq) as one of the winners of the first round of the ETC Grants DAO program!

We emailed Chirley of NerveNetwork with our questions, who responded the following:

NerveNetwork is an asset relay network connecting multiple blockchains, a gas-free blockchain. It was born in 2019, and its mainnet was launched in 2020. It has been operating in a steady state for 3 years. 

NerveNetwork aims to connect all isolated blockchains and establish a cross-chain asset exchange network, providing all necessary underlying support for DeFi ecosystems. We also want to let every digital asset holder experience truly secure, free, and transparent DeFi application services.

NerveNetwork currently supports 26 blockchains including Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, zkSync, Optimism, Tron, Linea, EOS EVM, KAVA, Harmony, KCC, Heco, OKC, NULS, Avalanche, Fantom, Cronos,  Kava, REI, ETHW,  ENULS, etc.

We have a full suite of NerveNetwork ecosystem products that can maximize profits for any ETC ecosystem projects, which are all free to all projects once the tunnel is completed!

The list of ecosystems includes: NerveBridge, NerveSwap, NerveFarm, NerveScan, Nerve Info, SwapBox and ParaBox, etc.

We intend to implement our cross-chain bridge to the ETC ecosystem. We applied and were granted a total $20,000 worth of $ETC.

How are we going to spend the grant?

To add an ETC/NVT liquidity Pool on NerveSwap. 

We asked for a $20,000 grant in $ETC token from your side, and our team will provide another $20,000 in $NVT (our underlying token). With these funds, we will add an ETC/NVT pool on NerveSwap.

Users can use any other blockchain assets to exchange $ETC across chains, which is beneficial for other network users to enter ETC blockchain.
