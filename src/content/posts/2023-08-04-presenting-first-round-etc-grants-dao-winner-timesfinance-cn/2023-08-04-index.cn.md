As the pioneering platform, it enables leveraged lending for Uniswap V3's LPs. Users can leverage their assets and borrow against their V3LPs through TimesFinance, thus amplifying their capital utilization. TimesFinance also extends its support to LPs from Curve V2, Sushiswap, Dodo, and other DEXs. It facilitates LPs to engage in mining and comparative price analysis within the protocol.
