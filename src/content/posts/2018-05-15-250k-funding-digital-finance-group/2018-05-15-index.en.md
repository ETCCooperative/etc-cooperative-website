## Funding From Digital Finance Group

The ETC Cooperative (the “ECC”) is pleased to announce a $250,000 donation from Digital Finance Group; a major investor in Cryptocurrency based out of Shanghai China. This very generous donation will be used by the ECC to fund our ongoing community outreach, and promote the benefits that ETC provides to developers. To date the ETC Cooperative has promoted the ETC community, developed the ecosystem and helped to maintain important ETC utilities such as block explorer software and user documentation. We plan to use this funding to continue our work on these goals and much more.
