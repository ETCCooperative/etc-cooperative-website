Weâ€™re excited to announce that we will be reigniting our original ETC newsletter as [**ETC Weekly**](https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/h1d0x0). With thousands of [Ethereum Classic](https://ethereumclassic.org/) OG subscribers and stakeholders already signed up since 2017, the new ETC Weekly will kick-off every Monday highlighting the happenings of the previous week and what to expect in the immediate week. In addition to ETC news and developments, ETC Weekly will be used for any consequential network security notifications as it has historically been used for.

ETC Weekly is brought to you by the [ETC Cooperative](https://etccooperative.org/), a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity dedicated to supporting Ethereum Classic. 

The first ETC Weekly will kick-off today, October 27, at 4:00 PM (16:00) Pacific Time. So, you still have some time to subscribe [**here**](https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/h1d0x0).
