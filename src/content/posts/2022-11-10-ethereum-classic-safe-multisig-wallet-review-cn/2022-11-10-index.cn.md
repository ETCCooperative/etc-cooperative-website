## Who Created the Safe Multisig App?

The [Safe Multisig App](https://gnosis-safe.io/) was created by [Gnosis](https://gnosis.io/) which was originally a prediction market dapp on the Ethereum network, but the team has now transformed into a general Ethereum infrastructure company.

Safe works on Ethereum and other smart contracts networks and now it is deployed on ETC as well.

## What Is the Ethereum Classic Safe Multisig App?

The ETC Cooperative core development team, specifically core developer [Chris Ziogas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ziogaschr/), has deployed the Safe Multisig App to Ethereum Classic so it may be used on that blockchain.

Safe is widely used for its multisignature security. It is a wallet app to create multisig wallets (or more accurately smart contracts that work like multisig wallets) for both individuals and teams.

Individuals can create multisignature wallets inside Safe with a combination of their own browser based, desktop based, mobile, or hardware wallet addresses so that they may increase security of their crypto assets.

Teams may create multisignature wallets which include the addresses of some or all team members where they need M-of-N signatures to be able to sign transactions. For example, if a team is composed of 5 members, they may set an ETC Safe wallet to send transactions only if 3-of-5 signatures sign them. 

## Ethereum Classic Safe Features

### 1. Web based

For now ETC Safe is available on the web at [multisig.etccooperative.org](https://multisig.etccooperative.org). However, it will be released for desktop and mobile depending on usage.

### 2. Assets

ETC Safe supports the native token $ETC, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs.

### 3. Wallet connections

As ETC Safe manages basically multisig wallets, each multisig signatory needs to connect with their personal wallet (or private keys). For this, ETC Safe connects with MetaMask, WalletConnect, Trezor, Ledger, and various other wallet brands.

### 4. Dapps

From ETC Safe, users may interact from their multisig wallets with any kind of dapps on ETC. For now there are a few dapps available by default, but users may connect the dapps they wish to use on ETC manually, or dapp developers may communicate with the [Ethereum Classic core developers](https://github.com/ETCCooperative) to request for their dapps to be added to the dapp catalogue inside ETC Safe.

### 5. Sections

Safe has five sections, very much as normal wallets:

**Assets:** The assets section basically shows users their holding in the current multisig wallet they are managing.

**Transactions:** The transactions section has the list of all transactions for the multisig wallet.

**Address book:** The address book has not only the addresses where crypto assets were sent and received, but also the ones that are used as co-signers in the different multisig wallets inside ETC Safe.

**Dapps:** The dapps section lists all the dapps that are registered within ETC Safe. Dapp developers must [contact](https://github.com/ETCCooperative) the ETC core dev team to ask for their dapps to be included. However, individual users may connect the dapps they wish to their ETC Safe multisig wallets to use them. 

**Settings:** The settings section is used to set or make changes to how each multisig wallet inside Safe works. For example, users may change what addresses may sign wallets and how many signatures are needed to send transactions per wallet.

## How Does It Work?

This is the sequence to create an ETC multisignature wallet using [Safe](https://multisig.etccooperative.org):

### 1. On the home of Ethereum Classic Safe, click on "+ Create new Safe".

### 2. Select what wallet and address you wish to use for this Safe.

Your options are MetaMask, WalletConnect, Trezor, Ledger, and several more if you click on "Show more".

For this example, we chose MetaMask.

### 3. Add the owners who will sign in this multisig wallet and the number of signatures needed to send transactions.

In this case we added two hypothetical individuals "Alice" and "Bob" with dummy addresses, but here you would put real persons and addresses of your real team.

### 4. Label your wallet for ease of use and to categorize them.

In this example we named our multisignature wallet "Business Crypto Safe" but you may use the label your prefer. Remember you may have many ETC Safe wallets so you will be able to organize them by name in this way.

### 5. Review the details and create multisig wallet.

The final step is to review the details and parameters you selected for your multisignature wallet. Once you confirm everything is fine, then press "Create" and your multisignature wallet will be deployed as a smart contract on the Ethereum Classic blockchain.
