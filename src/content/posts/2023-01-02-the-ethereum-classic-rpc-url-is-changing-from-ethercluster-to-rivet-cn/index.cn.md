## IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT:

The ETC Cooperative is changing the RPC URL for the Ethereum Classic mainnet from Etherecluster to Rivet.

This is important information for wallet operators, exchanges, mining pools, dapps or any other Ethereum Classic service or application who uses Ethercluster as an endpoint to send transactions and query the mainnet.

## The following Ethercluster RPC endpoint will be discontinued on July 1st of 2023:

The Ethercluster endpoint that will be discotinued on July 1st is:

[https://ethercluster.com/etc](https://ethercluster.com/etc)

The migration may be done immediately to the following RPC endpoint:

[https://etc.rivet.link](https://etc.rivet.link)

## Rationale

The mission of the ETC Cooperative is to support the Ethereum Classic network and ecosystem through core development and maintenance, infrastructure support, grants and sponsorships, and marketing and communications. 

Many of these functions are done through third party professionals and services as the cooperative does not necessarily have the staff and capabilities to perform some dedicated tasks and functions such as continuous and uninterrupted maintenance and support.

We have provided free public endpoints to the ETC ecosystem since mid-2019 which has allowed wallets, dapps and other services to connect to a publicly accessible ETC node to query the blockchain or to submit transactions.

As a small non-profit we are not well equipped to provide 24/7 operational support and have concluded that everyone would be better served if another team were to operate the endpoint service.

## About Rivet

[Rivet](https://rivet.cloud/) is an established company with a professional team dedicated to providing APIs for the blockchain industry. They have a track record of providing scalable infrastructure and privacy with total simplicity and at very reasonable prices.

The ETC Cooperative will continue to finance the cost of the free APIs and public endpoints through a contractor agreement with Rivet.

## Enterprise-Grade Support

Rivet provides:

- Up-to-date, easy-to-navigate documentation.
- Access to real human beings who care about user success.
- And a 99.95% Uptime guarantee.

## Please Make Plans for the Migration

Once again, the old endpoint:

[https://ethercluster.com/etc](https://ethercluster.com/etc)

Will be discontinued on July 1st of 2023 and replaced with:

[https://etc.rivet.link](https://etc.rivet.link)

We urge RPC endpoint users to make plans to migrate as soon as possible.
