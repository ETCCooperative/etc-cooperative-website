We are pleased to announce [ETC Cooperative's 2020 Retrospective](/ETC-Cooperative-Retrospective-2020.pdf). The mission of the ETC Coop is to steward the development of the Ethereum Classic protocol and to support the growth of a mature ecosystem around that protocol.There are three pillars to this mission:

- Accelerate adoption of ETC technology by individuals and enterprises through effective branding, marketing and education.
- Foster collaboration between ecosystem participants including developers, miners, investors, enterprises and end-users.
- Mature Governance and Transparency â€“ efficient and transparent governance framework, including use of funds.

This 2020 retrospective for the ETC Coop is organized around these three pillars - Adoption, Collaboration and Governance. The retrospective is another product of the revamp of the ETC Cooperative's governance and transparency which was put in place at the Annual General Meeting held on 17th March 2020.
