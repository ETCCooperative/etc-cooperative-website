We are happy to present HebeBlock of the HebeSwap Oracle project as one of the winners of the first round of the ETC Grants DAO program!

HebeBlock is a team based in China, and following is our email interview that we conducted with them as a videoconference was not possible due to language barriers.

Donald McIntyre (DM): Can you describe the team please?

HebeBlock (HB): Of course, I can describe the team for you. Currently, our core team consists of three members.  
  
The first member is Zhang, the founder, who has extensive experience in blockchain and wallet development. They are proficient in JavaScript, Java, and NodeJS development, and have participated in Nxt, Ardor customer development, and Cosmos JsSdk development and IRIS development.  
  
Our second team member is a Java architect with many years of experience in Java enterprise application development. They specialize in high concurrency and big data analysis, and have led the team in providing streamlined services for government institutions, banks, and internet companies. They also participated in the development and design of the SEVC property rights trading market and are currently responsible for the smart contract development of some HEBE projects such as HENS (.etc domain) and other products.  
  
Lastly, we have our front-end engineer Candy. They are proficient in Vue, React, and Cordova, focusing on front-end development for projects such as HEBESWAP and HEBEWALLET. Candy has extensive development experience and has worked in several financial industry companies.  

DM: Can you describe the project please?

HB: HebeSwap Oracle is a blockchain middleware that enables off-chain data integration into the Ethereum Classic (ETC) blockchain, expanding the range of smart contract and blockchain technology applications. ETC's focus on immutability, decentralization, compatibility with Ethereum, robustness, and strong community support make it an ideal platform for HebeSwap Oracle.

In the early days of building HENS (.etc domain name) on the ETC blockchain, we faced the challenge of not having an Oracle to calculate domain name registration fees based on stable real-time prices. To overcome this, we resorted to manual modification of the domain name fee.

However, in the future, with the integration of off-chain data, such as ETC prices, into the ETC blockchain through Hebe Oracle, we can now easily obtain accurate ETC prices and calculate domain name fees automatically. This not only solves the problem for HENS, but also benefits other potential DAPPs on the ETC blockchain.

DM: How much money did you receive from the ETC Grants DAO?

HB: We received a $50,000.00 grant.

Here is a possible timeline and project milestones for HebeSwap Oracle:

Milestone 1 (M1): Start the HebeSwap Oracle website

Estimated completion date: (1-2 week)
$USD value paid upon completion: $5,000
Deliverable: HebeSwap Oracle website launched and live, providing information about the middleware, its features, and benefits.  
  
  
Milestone 2 (M2): Write HebeSwap Oracle contract

Estimated completion date: (1-2 week)
$USD value paid upon completion: $20,000
Deliverable: HebeSwap Oracle contract written and deployed on the Ethereum Classic blockchain, providing a secure and reliable middleware for smart contracts to access off-chain data.  
  
Milestone 3 (M3): Test and verify the HebeSwap Oracle contract

Estimated completion date: (1-2 week)  
$USD value paid upon completion: $10,000  
Deliverable: HebeSwap Oracle contract thoroughly tested and verified for security, reliability, and scalability, ensuring that it is ready for deployment on a large scale.  
  
Milestone 4 (M4): HebeSwap Oracle is officially deployed, and the data is constantly updated

Estimated completion date: (1-2 week)
$USD value paid upon completion: $15,000  
Deliverable: HebeSwap Oracle deployed on the Ethereum Classic blockchain, with real-time data feeds constantly updated and available to smart contracts. The middleware is integrated into several dApps and smart contracts, demonstrating its functionality and effectiveness.

Note that these milestones and completion dates are only estimates and are subject to change based on various factors, including technical difficulties, regulatory requirements, and market conditions. The HebeSwap Oracle team may adjust the project plan and milestones as needed to ensure the success of the project.

DM: Why did you choose ETC?

HB: We chose ETC as our platform for developing Dapps due to an interesting experience in December 2021. At that time, we were seeking a change, and community members recommended ETC to us as a platform for developing Dapps. We tweeted about ETC, announcing our plan to build a Dapp on the platform. We received a lot of positive feedback from ETC users.  
  
As a result, we built our first Dapp, Hebe Swap, on the ETC blockchain. Later, we developed more Dapps such as HENS (.etc domain name), ETC block explorer:  [etcerscan.com](http://etcerscan.com/), Etcdesktop: Ethereum Classic Desktop Node Client, ETC Browser Extension Wallet, and ETC public RPC: [etc.etcdesktop.com](http://etc.etcdesktop.com/)
