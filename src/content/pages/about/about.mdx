In April 2017, Grayscale Investments, a digital currency asset management firm and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group, launched the Ethereum Classic Investment Trust (“ETC Trust”). Grayscale held the view that the market was underappreciating the value in Ethereum Classic as a global digital currency and smart contract payment platform. Through a traditional investment vehicle, the ETC Trust allows investors to gain exposure to ETC’s disruptive potential and invest in its growth and development.

Grayscale, as sponsor of the ETC Trust, has committed to appropriating one-third of the Trust’s management fee into the ECC for a period of 3 years beginning from the Trust’s inception date, April 24, 2017. The Ethereum Classic Cooperative was born from these initial contributions.
