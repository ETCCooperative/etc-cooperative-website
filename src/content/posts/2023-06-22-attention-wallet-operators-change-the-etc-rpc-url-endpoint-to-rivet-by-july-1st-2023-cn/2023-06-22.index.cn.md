This is an important annpuncement for wallet operators who use the [ETHERCLUSTER](https://ethercluster.com/) public endpoints to access the Ethereum Classic blockchain:

**PLEASE CHANGE YOUR ENDPOINTS FROM ETHERCLUSTER TO RIVET BY JULY 1ST 2023.**

As [we announced](https://etccooperative.org/posts/2023-01-02-the-ethereum-classic-rpc-url-is-changing-from-ethercluster-to-rivet-en) in Januray of this year, the ETC Cooperative is changing the RPC URL for the Ethereum Classic mainnet from Ethercluster to Rivet.

**The Ethercluster endpoint that will be discontinued on July 1st is:**

https://ethercluster.com/etc

**The new one to be used, which is already active so you may migrate right now, is the following:**

https://etc.rivet.link

You can learn about the rationale, RIVET as a professional provider, and their support capabilities [here](https://etccooperative.org/posts/2023-01-02-the-ethereum-classic-rpc-url-is-changing-from-ethercluster-to-rivet-en).

**PLEASE MAKE SURE TO MIGRATE BY JULY 1ST 2023.**
