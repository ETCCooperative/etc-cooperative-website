## The ETC Grants Program

The ETC Grants program was launched in November 2022 to support the growth
of the [Ethereum Classic](https://ethereumclassic.org) ecosystem.
As of September 2022, ETC is **the #1 Proof-of-Work ("POW") smart contract platform**
on the planet, but its application ecosystem does not yet reflect
that reality.  That is what we plan on changing in the very near future
with this grants programs.

(*Data above as of Nov 8th 2022*)

## How is it going to work?

The grants process will be open for proposals once every quarter.
A timetable will be published for each round showing:

- When the process is open for applications.
- Total maximum funding assigned to this round.
- What kind of projects will be welcomed in that round.
- How to apply for a grant and what kind of information you must provide.
- Expectations on likely USD amounts for particular proposals.
- Timelines for applications, for assessments, for payout and for progress reporting.

Everything will be happening via this [ETC Grants website](https://etcgrantsdao.org)
and the on the various [ETC Grants channels](https://twitter.com/etcgrantsdao).
Grant recipients will funded using $ETC, to aligh incentives with the network.

# Who will be making the decisions?

Decisions on the initial round of grants will be made by a committee
appointed by Bitmain, Antpool and ETC Cooperative, as the initial donors into this
grants process.  If further donors join the process, they will be able to
participate in the process as well.   The decision making process might be
opened up more to ETC community members in the future - even perhaps as an
actual DAO - but for the time being getting the funds into the hands of
developers and community members is the top priority.

Standing committee members:
- Bitmain (Xmei)
- Antpool (Leon, Lucien, Rory)
- ETC Cooperative (Bob, Alison)
- Grayscale (Craig)

Rotating committee members:
- Istora

# Round 1!

- The first round of ETC Grants was opened on Thursday 10th November 2022, when the
program was announced on stage by Xmei Lin, Head of Marketing for Bitmain.
The application process will be open until end-of-day Sunday 4th
December 2022 (so applications are open for just over 3 weeks).
- The projects receiving funding will be announced on Thursday 15th December
and payments will be made to the recipients that day.
- **$1M USD worth of ETC** is available for successful applicants in this
first round of grants, which was funded by Antpool ($750K) and ETC Coop ($250K).
- Individual grants proposals cannot exceed **$100K worth of ETC** each.
- To apply for funding in round one, please visit **https://etcgrantsdao.org**.
- We are seeking interesting and innovative dapps, along with foundational
projects for enriching the ETC Defi ecosystem.  We also welcome proposals
related to education, to communication of ETC's unique value proposition,
to both local and international events.
- All projects must make their "outputs" available using permissive open
source licensing (Apache 2, Mozilla MPL 2 or Creative Commons).  Funding
will not be provided for projects seeking to build propriatory solutions.  The
copyright will remain with the authors, but licensing must be permissive
and patents must not be filed on the outputs of these projects.
- We will *not be considering* applications seeking to retroactively
fund prior work which is already completed.
- Applicants are obliged to provide two status reports in return for receiving
grants funding.  The first report will be mid-project and the second report
would be due at the completion of the project, or when work towards its
stated goals comes to an end for whatever reason.  These reports will all
be made public, as will the proposals themselves, and feedback/rationale
on the proposals explaining how they were viewed, and how these appraisals
informed the decisions on which proposals would be funded for this particular round.
- The first status report will be due 6 weeks after the funds are released,
so around the end of January.  The final status reports will be due mid-February.
- The intention for the program is for everything to be completely
transparent so that applicants can see which proposals are having success,
likely "market rates" for proposals and so on.

# Round 2!

- The second round of ETC Grants will open around 3 months after the first
round, so maybe mid-February 2023.
- It is expected that the process will be similar to the first round, but
we will iterate on the process as we go, and see what is working well and
where there is ambiguity or other problems.
