**TL;DR**

The ETC Cooperative is withdrawing its support for the [ECIP-1098 Treasury
proposal](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1098).

**Why?**

We spent many months collaborating with IOHK on reworking the published
proposal.  It became apparent over time that IOHK's vision of a treasury was sharply at odds with our expectations.

The final straw was over the “sweeping mechanism” which Bob had proposed.
Unspent client team funds would be swept forward into the community grants
pool.  That mechanism was intended to ensure that differences in spending across client teams, or excesses of funding due to rising ETC prices would not end up as
private profit for the client teams.

That mechanism was unacceptable to IOHK but was a "must have" for ETC Cooperative.

Without adequate systems in place to ensure transparency, accountability and ultimately a capped profit margin, the treasury system that IOHK desired
was never going to be accepted by the community and with valid reason.

Chris Hitchcott just wrote [an excellent article](https://www.ethereumclassicclassic.org/)
summarizing anti-treasury arguments along with commentary on how badly a contentious chain-split might play out.  It is very long, but well worth the time to read, or at least to skim.

**Why consider protocol intrinsic funding in the first place?**

Currently, all of the funding for ETC protocol and ecosystem development is protocol extrinsic funding from Grayscale and DFG.  That funding is fragile.

The Coop only has an agreement with Grayscale until April 2022 and we are working on the assumption that funding will be discontinued at that time.

The scope of work funded by DFG has shrunk down to the three core developers working on Core-Geth.  Even that funding could be cut at any time because it is no longer part of any coherent broader ETC strategy for DFG.   All the other pillars of their former ETC strategy - grants, incubator, investments, social media presence, hard fork coordination, community outreach - are gone, together with the individuals hired to fill those roles.  There is no longer any mention of ETC Labs or ETC Core on James’s social media profile or on DFG’s website, and their ETC social media accounts have been abandoned since January.

**What if NO treasury proposal can be made to fly?**

The Coop has more than sufficient funds at the time of writing due to the higher ETC prices over the last few months.  If those high contributions from Grayscale continue until April 2022 then we will have a warchest which we could use over the coming years to keep the Cooperative running, but it would not be sustainable in the long term because there would be no funds incoming.

In the absence of a protocol-level treasury the ETC Cooperative itself could
have an ongoing grants program using those reserve funds, but it would be
orders of magnitude smaller than any protocol intrinsic grants program.  The program could only continue until those funds ran out, and then both the
grants program and the ETC Cooperative itself would come to a close.  Would that
be the most productive use for those funds?  That is unclear.

If DFG were to defund the Core-Geth team in the coming years then Coop would
have to start funding that development work, because Core-Geth is used by
96% of node operators.  ETC Cooperative would become “last man standing” for
all ETC funding needs, which is not practical nor decentralized in any way.

**The outlook for ETC**

To be clear, whatever happens, ETC Cooperative sees a bright future for the
ETC protocol, irrespective of the fate of any of the current real world entities
within the ETC ecosystem (ourselves included).  To quote an individual who has been around since the project's earliest days:

*"ETC is a cockroach, in the best possible ways"*

**Transparency**

Throughout this process with ECIP-1098, our worst failing was that discussions happened behind closed doors for far too long.  That process began with good intentions - to revamp the proposal into a healthy state which
would address the many concerns which had clearly been communicated.  It was
self-evident that the proposal as originally published needed lots of iteration before it stood any chance of adoption.  Sadly, that process dragged on for months and the proposal never got to a state where it was ready for release
so we never got to the productive public discussion which we hoped to enable.

We apologize for our part in this unhappy sequence of events.  The outcome
was sharply at-odds with the transparency which is a core value of the
ETC Cooperative (as evidenced by our regular reporting and general conduct), and that is something we pledge never to repeat.
