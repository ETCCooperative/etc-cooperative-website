DM: Can you describe the project please?

L: MechaverseDAO is a decentralized entertainment platform to create a Japanese mecha universe.

It will open the gateway to the web3 mecha metaverse world, attracting more Japanese IPs, mecha IPs, and gamefi projects. The native token of the ecosystem is MM, and each project within the ecosystem can issue its own subtoken, such as MC.

We are building the concept of Mecha metaverse, envisioning a Japanese universe of mechanized warfare. Mechaverse is the first game under MechaverseDao. In the future, MechaverseDao (MMDAO) will develop more games, expanding the immersive experience within the metaverse.

DM: How much money did you receive from the ETC Grants DAO?

L: We applied for and were approved for $25,000.

DM: Why did you choose ETC?

The goal of Mechaverse is to create a mecha game ecosystem in a multi-chain ecosystem, so we will actively participate in the building of the ecosystem of excellent public chains.
