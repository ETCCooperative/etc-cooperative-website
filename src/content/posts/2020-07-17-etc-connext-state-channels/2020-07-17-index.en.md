We are pleased to announce that Connext State Channels smart contracts have been deployed on the Ethereum Classic mainnet chain and that our API is currently available to be used by the public!

You can get started on integrating the ETC Connext endpoint as a state channel for your ETC dApp.

State channels allow for a host of layer-2 solutions that can perform transaction-heavy operations that settle later on the main chain. They allow for blockchain scalability by absorbing the bulk of transactions so the state of the blockchain doesn’t grow as fast as it currently is.

You can get started with the ETC Connext node by using the following endpoint in your dApp: “https://indra.etcstatechannel.com/api”

## State Channels
State Channels are essentially like the Lightning Network of EVM-based chains and networks. A state channel allows for multiple transactions off-chain that have final settlement on chain after. This allows for much faster transaction that is normally allowed on-chain. For example, let’s say you’re buying coffee. You only own gold bars which you want to use for transacting. It’ll take the cafe a long time to weigh the gold and convert its weigh to equivalent USD price in order to properly value how much its worth for the transaction. A cafe would certainly prefer a credit card transaction or cash. The gold in this example is basically you using on-chain payments like say Bitcoin or ETC. You want faster payments for quick transactions like a cup of coffee than using an on-chain solution.

You need a payment network like the Lightning Network.

Connext State Channel is a fast payment network that now works with Ethereum Classic.

## Making a Connection
We must first ensure we have Node installed and that the connext client is installed with:
```
npm install @connext/client
```

Then, we make a javascript file that contains our logic for instantiating a channel
```
const connext = require('@connext/client');
const eth = require('ethers')

var channel;
const getChannel = async () => {
  if (channel) {return channel}
  channel = await connext.connect({
    ethProviderUrl: "https://www.ethercluster.com/etc",
    signer: eth.Wallet.createRandom().privateKey,
    nodeUrl: "https://indra.etcstatechannel.com/api",
  });

  console.log(`Client created successfully!`);
  console.log(` - Public Identifier: ${channel.publicIdentifier}`);

  return channel;
}

module.exports = { getChannel }
```

Here, we are using the Connext Client to create a channel that connects to the Connext ETC node.

Our const `getChannel` creates a Connext channel with the properties of the ETC endpoint provided `https://indra.etcstatechannel.com/api` as well as our ETHProvider being the Ethercluster ETC endpoint: `https://www.ethercluster.com/etc`

For the purposes of this demo, we create a random wallet as our signer.

We then log the public identifier of the created channel of that client.

In another file for our main logic, we create a simple Express.js server that instantiates the client.

```
const { getChannel } = require('./channel')
const express = require('express')

const app = express()

const port = process.env.PORT || '8080'

app.all('*', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('OK')
})

app.listen(port, async () => {
  await getChannel()
})
```

Here, we are importing our previous file `channel.js` and importing Express.js to serve on port 8080.

When we run it, we get the following output:
```

The final outputs showed that a client connection was successfully created! 

## Next Steps
The Connext team has included a wealth of examples and applications to inspire you.

There’s a [DaiCard](https://github.com/connext/indra/tree/staging/modules/daicard) example, which is also live for now on our website but will need to be removed soon to avoid confusion.

There’s also an example of a [Twitter Tipping bot](https://gitlab.com/bohendo/tipdai/-/tree/master/src) with Dai that you can refer to for building state channels for ETC dapps now.

You can do a lot of things with the Connext client connection you established. You can deposit into the Connext client instance. You can transfer ETC to a different Connext client channel. 

To find those, you can reference the client’s public identifier as shown in the logs above and the code via `channel.publicIdentifier`.

For more examples and what you can do with the API, please checkout the [Connext documentations](https://docs.connext.network/en/latest/).
