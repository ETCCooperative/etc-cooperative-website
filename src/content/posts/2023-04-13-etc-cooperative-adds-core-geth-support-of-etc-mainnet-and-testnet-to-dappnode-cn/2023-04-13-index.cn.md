We are pleased to announce that the ETC Cooperative has [added support](https://twitter.com/DAppNode/status/1645784583932346381) for the Ethereum Classic node client Core Geth to [DappNode Home](https://dappnode.com/), the node client hardware device that may be used to run blockchain nodes from the home or office.

Ethereum Classic Core Geth core developer Chris Ziogas worked on the project developing and maintaining the corresponding ETC Core Geth packages for the integration of the ETC mainnet and Mordor testnet. Both instances are available now for DappNode users to download and activate.

Blockchains are peer-to-peer networks of computers where each node is a machine running a software client that enables it to communicate with other nodes. 

A blockchain node is one of these participating machines running the software client that contains the protocol to be able to be a member of the network.

Running a node provides higher security to users and dapp developers as well as increasing the overall security of the network. It is also very important for exchanges, investors, institutions, and general blockchain services.

Running a node is a way to access the blockchain directly, thus more securely, to query accounts, balances, and dapps, and to send transactions.

Because running nodes is relatively costly because servers would be needed to have them on all the time, and due to the size of the blockchain (an ETC full node size is currently around 80 GB), it is difficult to run them on regular computers, much less on machines that are meant for daily use.

To solve this problem, there are companies that have developed very practical specialized devices that are only dedicated to running blockchain nodes.

DappNode is one such company with its product DappNode Home which is a device that connects to the local WiFi network at home or office, and from there users may set up different blockchain nodes, including ETC.

**Some of the use cases for running an ETC node on DappNode are the following:**

**Your local wallet:** Instead of using third parties, users may have their non-custodial wallets in their local machines connect to the blockchain directly through their own local nodes.

**Access globally:** DappNode may be setup to provide access through VPN connection to its owners with privacy even if they are away, anywhere in the world.

**Make public:** The ETC node may be set up as a public endpoint, providing the general public access to the blockchain.

**Your dapp:** Dapp developer teams may use their DappNode to provide access to the chain for their dapps so they donâ€™t have to depend on the large centralized cloud node providers.

**Automatic updates:** DappNode may be set up to update the Ethereum Classic software client automatically so no upgrades, bug fixes, or hard forks are missed.

**Censorship resistant:** By running a full node, the level of security achieved is the highest possible.

At the ETC Cooperative we are very proud of this achievement and we invite the ETC community at large to [run](https://dappnode.com) Ethereum Classic nodes! We will be producing tutorials and guides on how to run ETC nodes with DappNode in the near future.
