[Consensus](https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2020) is the leading blockchain conference of the year and the highlight of New York blockchain week.
In the height of the Coronovirus pandemic, Consensus 2020 will take a different form
than in previous years, as a virtual conference free of charge for participants.

**Foundations at Consensus: Distributed**

Foundations is a new program within Consensus designed to put the spotlight on thriving blockchain ecosystems. Itâ€™s a chance for protocols and projects to design a series of conference sessions specifically aimed at their community: which means developers and other technical contributors as well as the investors, customers and founders. 

We are delighted to announce that [Ethereum Classic](https://ethereumclassic.org)
will be participating in the Foundations track of Consensus, with an hour of
content devoted to ETC.

At the time of writing, that content is provisionally planned for **Tuesday 12th, 3-4pm Eastern**.

**What will we be covering in this session?**

The last twelve months have been a very exciting time for Ethereum Classic, moving
from the nadir of the 51% attacks in Janury 2019 through two hard-forks within a
few months (Atlantis is September 2019 and Agharta in January 2020), and ETC
Summit in October 2019.  After several years of slow progress, ETC is really moving.

Join us to find out what is so special about ETC.

We will preview the ETC Phoenix hardfork due in June along with other recent and coming developments in ETC.
