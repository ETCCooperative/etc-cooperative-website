The Ethereum Classic Cooperative Inc (“ETC Coop”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware as an LLC
on 7th September 2017. The legal entity was incorporated with the explicitly stated goal of conversion
to a non-profit entity in support of the ETC ecosystem. That application was filed with the IRS
on 10th May 2018.  The ETC Coop was granted 501(c)(3) public charity status on 14th November 2018,
retroactive to the date of filing.

Donations to ETC Coop are tax deductible under IRC Section 170 for US taxpayers, both individual
and corporate.  Enterprises investing in infrastructure or other “public goods” within the ETC
ecosystem can do so in a more tax-efficient manner by donating to the ETC Coop rather than investing
directly.  Private foundations often fulfill a similar function in other ICO-funded cryptocurrency
projects, along with holding ICO funds, trademarks, driving roadmap and other centralized functions.

In that sense, ETC is quite unique (along with Bitcoin) in having none of those centralizing
functions. There is no ETC Foundation (very intentionally). There was no ICO for ETC.  The
abandoned chain we now call ETC was picked up and kept alive by volunteers following the DAO Fork.

Just over a year later the ETC Coop was formed, to provide some much needed (but non-exclusive)
funding and support for the ETC ecosystem.  There is nothing “official” in ETC, including the role
of the ETC Coop within the ecosystem.  The ETC Coop and its staff have no special influence within
ETC other than whatever respect our actions have earned.  Earning that respect is a
“forever process”.  Any other group of individuals or other legal entity could displace the
ETC Coop tomorrow if we cease to be good citizens.
